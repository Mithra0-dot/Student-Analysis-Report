📊 Project Overview
A data science mini-project analyzing how various factors (demographics, parental education, and preparation) impact student test scores. 
This project utilizes Python's data stack to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize trends.


🚀 FeaturesData Cleaning: Handled using Pandas and NumPy.
Demographic Analysis: Visualized student distribution using Pie Charts.Score Distribution: Analyzed performance density across genders using Seaborn.


📈 Visualizations Included
Bar Chart (Matplotlib): Compares average student scores based on Parental Level of Education.
Pie Chart (Matplotlib): Visualizes the percentage distribution of students across different Race/Ethnicity groups.
Density Plot (Seaborn): Analyzes the distribution and "spread" of Math Scores to compare performance between genders.


🛠️ Tools Used
Python 3.13
Pandas: For data manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For professional data visualizations.
VS Code: Primary IDE.
